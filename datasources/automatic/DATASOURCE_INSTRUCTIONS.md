# Datasources

## How to add sources
1. Please add official datasources of any language to the sources.csv file
2. The CSV is sorted by link values, please put additions into the right order (to avoid duplicates)
3. Please fill out as many columns as you can - it might make sense to have the scraper fill out values individually. 
E.g. when the FAQ site contains text in different languages (use automatic language detection 
from covid_nlp/language/detect_language.py) or if each FAQ entry has a dedicated category.
